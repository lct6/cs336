        <ul>
            <li>3.1</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Express.js is built on top of node.js. Express adds a web application framework/features to node.js. So, it is more specialized for web develpment. Both are light weight and efficient.</li>
                    <li>The package.json file is probably basic info for the server as it specifies the name, version, and other basic info about the program that it will be running. If you change/add to the scripts you then can type the name of the script in the commandline and it will run it</li>
                </ul>
            <li>3.2</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>They are static in the sense that images and css are always going to do the same thing. An image doesn't change and css always follows the same rules. They could also be static in the sense that they are all in the same folder and won't move unless someone manually moves them.  </li>
                    <li>It still servers up the hello world message for me. I believe that this is so because the path in the url is different (I am not specifiying a path or file to look at).</li>
                </ul>
